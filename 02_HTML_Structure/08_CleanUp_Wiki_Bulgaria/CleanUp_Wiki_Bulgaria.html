    <p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karanovo_culture" title="Karanovo culture">Karanovo culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians" title="Thracians">Thracians</a>, <a

            title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars" title="Bulgars">Bulgar</a> horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire" title="First Bulgarian Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which dominated most of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> and significantly influenced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavs" title="Slavs">Slavic</a> cultures by developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script" title="Cyrillic script">Cyrillic script</a>. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II"
            title="Basil II">Basil II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bulgarian_Empire" title="Second Bulgarian Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Asen_II"
            title="Ivan Asen II">Ivan Asen II</a> (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries.

    <p>The <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%9378)" title="Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria" title="People&#39;s Republic of Bulgaria">one-party socialist state</a> and part of the Soviet-led <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. The ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Communist_Party" title="Bulgarian Communist Party">Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on power after the <a

Bulgaria then transitioned into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and a market-based economy.
