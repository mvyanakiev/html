    <p>This article is about the living species. For extinct relatives also known as elephants, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a>. For other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_(disambiguation)">Elephant (disambiguation)</a>.</p>

    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae"
            title="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> in the order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea"
            title="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant"
            title="African bush elephant">African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), the <a

    forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"
            title="Asian elephant">Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered
        throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan
        Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South
        Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast
        Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now
        extinct, members of the order include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae"
                title="Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere"

        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">mastodons</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also
        called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis" title="Proboscis">proboscis</a>),
        used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor" title="Incisor">incisors</a> grow into tusks,
        which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
        flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"
                title="Column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have
        larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
        backs.
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna"
            title="Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"
            title="Marsh">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">keystone
    species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their
        distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"
                title="Lion">lions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger" title="Tiger">tigers</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena" title="Hyena">hyenas</a>, and any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae"
                title="Canidae">wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants
        have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society" title="Fission–fusion society">fission–fusion
        society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows")
        tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
        related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy"
                title="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.
    </p>
    <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with
        other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a
        state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a>
        and aggression known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth" title="Musth">musth</a>,
        which helps them gain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)" title="Dominance (ethology)">dominance</a>
        and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on
        their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They
        communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"
                title="Infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication"

        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea" title="Cetacea">cetaceans</a>. They appear

        and show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy" title="Empathy">empathy</a> for dying

    <p>African elephants are listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">vulnerable</a>
        by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature"
                title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation
        of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"
                title="Endangered species">endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant
        populations is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade" title="Ivory trade">ivory
        trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" title="Poaching">poached</a>
        for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction"

        Elephants are used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal" title="Working animal">working
        animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
        controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus"
                title="Circus">circuses</a>. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in
        art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"
